# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Helping an up and coming playwright, by the name of Louise, who wants to start a crowdfunding campaign to help fund her play called Fever.

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to forecast and explore how different campaigns managed in relation to the variables launch dates and funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Based off the data collected, in regards to theater campaign funding categorized by successful, failed, and canceled, correlated to launch dates. The data suggests that successful theater campaign funding sources did exponentially well in late April and early May. In addition, the data suggests that the Spring and Summer seasons allowed for a more lucrative campaign funding factor.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Based on the data collected for plays categorized by successful, failed, and canceled, as well as correlated to the goal amount of the campaign funding source of theater plays. The data suggests the plays with a goal range of $1000 to $4999 displayed more successful outcomes. However, on the opposite spectrum of the goal amount, the goal range of $50000 or greater data displayed that 42% of plays were successful in achieving their goal amount, and 58% failed in achieving their goal amount. The data displays the notion that campaign funding sources, such as plays, should predict to achieve their goal amount if it is the range of $1000 to $4999. It is more of a gamble to have a goal amount of $50000 or greater.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The challenges and difficulties encountered within this project is the large and abundant size of the entire data sheet. It takes a while to methodically assess the data and determine what are the best variables to examine.

## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

Two conclusions that can be drawn from the analysis of the outcomes versus the launch dates is that the successful outcomes of theater campaigns exhibited doing very well at its highest peak in April to May. The data also examined that seasons played a critical part in the success of theater campaigns--the line graph also displayed the Spring and Summer seasons having lucrative theater campaigns.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

One apparent conclusion from the outcomes versus the goal amount line graph and data, displayed that the most successful campaign fundraising plays did virtually extremely well in achieving their goal amount of $1000 to $4999. It is highly likely that with a low range of a goal amount--a campaign fund raising category of plays will do well in achieving the low range goal amount.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

Some limitations of these data sets is that these types of graphs only work when there are whole figures. Another limitation is that these line charts are only for continuous data, such as data that is over a period of time or over a range of values.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

One graph that could be created and would be beneficial for further data analysis is a bar graph for subcategory statistics versus successful, failed, and canceled outcomes This type of graph would display which subcategory was most successful in their campaign fund raising. In addition, a bar graph displaying countries versus subcategory statistics would also be beneficial in displaying the which country was most successful in the subcategory of plays and theaters.
